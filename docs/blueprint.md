## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke creativity and sophistication in the design process.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) provides a clean, neutral backdrop that highlights the colorful designs and ensures readability of text.
- Accent color: Electric Violet (#8F00FF) as a vivid highlight color for interactive elements, voting buttons, and calls to action, emphasizing engagement and modernity.
- Clean and modern sans-serif fonts should be prioritized across the website. Font sizes should be carefully considered to create hierarchy and improve readability, particularly in the gallery and product descriptions.
- Use a consistent style of minimalist icons to represent different features and categories. These should be simple, clear, and aligned with the modern aesthetic, enhancing the user interface without overwhelming it.
- Implement a grid-based layout for the gallery and shop pages to present designs in a structured and visually appealing manner. The layout should be responsive, adapting fluidly to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on all devices.
- Employ subtle, non-distracting animations to enhance user interaction. Transitions should be smooth and provide feedback on actions, like a gentle color change on hover or a slide-in effect for new designs.
